# IronCryptor

An advanced file cryptor project.

---

## üöÄ Overview

IronCryptor is a robust and easy-to-use file encryption utility designed to protect your sensitive data with modern cryptographic standards. Built primarily with Python and PySide6, it offers a cross-platform graphical interface that simplifies the process of securing files and folders.

## ‚ú® Features

The project is structured to provide both a command-line interface (CLI) and a powerful Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Core Features
*   **Strong Encryption:** Utilizes industry-standard, modern encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256 GCM via the `cryptography` library).
*   **Parallel Processing:** Leverages multi-processing to handle multiple encryption/decryption tasks concurrently, significantly speeding up batch operations.
*   **Secure Shredding:** An optional feature to securely overwrite and delete original files after successful encryption, preventing data recovery.
*   **Cross-Platform GUI:** A sleek, modern interface built with PySide6, ensuring a consistent look and feel across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### GUI Specifics
*   **Drag-and-Drop Support:** Easily initiate encryption or decryption by dragging files and folders onto the application window.
*   **Theming:** Supports both Light and Dark themes for a comfortable user experience.
*   **Result Handling:** Allows users to easily save or drag the resulting encrypted/decrypted files from a dedicated result icon.
